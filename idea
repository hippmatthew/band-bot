Take a url

if playlist, add all urls to the queue
if single song, add just that url the the queue

start downloading each song in order, asynchronously:
  1. create a future that stores the songs filename
  2. in the future, the song is downloaded and returns the filename
  3. add the future to a song queue

when playing the song, pop the front of the song queue and request the value
then pass the file into ffmpeg to be played

loop until the queue is finished
